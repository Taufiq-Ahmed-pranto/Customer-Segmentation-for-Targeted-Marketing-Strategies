# Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Strategies

This project explores customer data analysis and segmentation to optimize marketing strategies. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and predictive modeling, we aim to identify distinct customer segments and predict their responses to promotions, enabling personalized and efficient marketing approaches.

## Project Overview

Understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies. This project leverages machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors and predict their likelihood of accepting marketing promotions. The insights gained from this analysis inform targeted marketing efforts, potentially enhancing customer engagement and improving campaign ROI.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and converting data types.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to provide deeper insights into customer behaviors, such as customer age and total amount spent.
3. **Clustering**: Applying K-means clustering to segment the customer base into distinct groups based on similarities in their features.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Training machine learning models to predict customer responses to promotions, comparing models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Customer Profiling**: Analyzing the clusters to create detailed profiles of each customer segment, informing targeted marketing strategies.

## Results

The analysis revealed two main customer segments with distinct characteristics:
- **Budget-Conscious Families**: Characterized by moderate income levels and higher family sizes, showing cautious spending behavior.
- **Affluent Professionals**: Featuring higher income, smaller family sizes, and significant spending, with moderate engagement with promotions.

The Random Forest model showed the highest overall accuracy in predicting promotion acceptance, making it the preferred choice for targeting marketing campaigns.

## Key Findings

- Customer segmentation allows for the identification of distinct groups within the customer base, enabling tailored marketing strategies.
- Predictive models can effectively forecast customer responses to promotions, with the Random Forest model performing best in our analysis.
- Detailed customer profiles support the development of personalized marketing approaches, enhancing customer engagement and campaign effectiveness.
