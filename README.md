## Introduction

Understanding customer behavior and preferences is critical for creating effective marketing strategies. This project aims to:

- Segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behaviors.
- Predict customer responses to marketing promotions.
- Provide actionable insights to inform personalized marketing approaches.

---

## Project Workflow

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as customer age, total spending, and behavioral patterns.
4. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for clustering and predictive modeling.
5. **Clustering**: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means clustering.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM) to predict promotion responses.
7. **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Assess model performance and interpret clusters for actionable insights.

## Key Features and Insights

- **Clustering**: Customers were grouped into two main segments:
  - **Budget-Conscious Families**: Moderate income, larger family sizes, cautious spending habits.
  - **Affluent Professionals**: Higher income, smaller family sizes, significant spending, moderate engagement with promotions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting promotion acceptance.
- **Customer Profiling**: Detailed analysis of customer clusters supports personalized marketing campaigns.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Converted categorical data into numerical formats using encoding methods.
- Identified and removed outliers to ensure data consistency.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Derived new features such as age groups, spending categories, and promotional engagement levels.

### 3. Clustering
- Applied K-means clustering to group customers based on features like income, spending, and engagement.

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
